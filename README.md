# Spell-Checker
We have a dictionary file that we insert (all lowercase dict) and a file that we want to spellcheck. This assignment uses Edit Distance, Qsort and Binary Search 

Note: the main body of code was the students, and the function calling file was the professor's. Edit distance function was created using the help of the professors notes on Edit Distance and the Binary Search was completed with the help of Geeks for Geeks Binary Search.
